***************************
`elastalk` Library Versions
***************************

The `elastalk` version numbers reflect the
`Elasticsearch <https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch>`_ with which they work.  The
*major* and *minor* version numbers reflect the Elasticsearch version, while the *patch*
indicates a revision to the `elastalk` library.

For example, version `6.5.1` is the *first* version of the `elastalk` library (indicated
by the patch version) built to work with version *6.5* of Elasticsearch.
