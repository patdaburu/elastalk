Getting Started
***************

Elastic Stack
-------------

Elasticsearch
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You don't need to install `Elasticsearch <https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch>`_ to
start using this library, but it won't be particularly useful until you start talking to a data
store.

To get started with Elasticsearch, consult the
`Elasticsearch docs <https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/getting-started.html>`_.

Kibana
^^^^^^

You don't absolutely *need* `Kibana <https://www.elastic.co/products/kibana>`_ to get started, but
if you want a tool to help you inspect and visualize your data, Kibana is for you.

To get started with Kibana, consult the
`Kibana docs <https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/getting-started.html>`_.

Installing the Library
======================

You can use pip to install `elastalk`.

.. code-block:: sh

    pip install elastalk
